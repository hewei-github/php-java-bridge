Installing the PHP/Java Bridge on Windows
-----------------------------------------
It is recommended to use the Linux or Unix version of the PHP/Java
Bridge.  Especially the Linux version can be installed very easily
(with the command rpm -i php-java-bridge*.rpm), supports fine-grained
access control through SEL, struct ucred and the linux abstract
namespace and allows one to audit the activity going through the web
server and the bridge.


* Install a J2RE >= 1.4.0, for example Sun JDK 1.5.0

* Download and extract php-java-bridge_*-win32-php5.zip into the
  folder: c:\php5.

* Double-Click on c:\php5\JavaBridge.jar

* Open a command window in c:\php5 and type:

   .\php-cgi test.php >result.html 

  Open the file result.html with a browser.  Search for the "java
  status" entry, it should be "java status: running", and examine the
  java properties at the bottom of the page. Search for "file.encoding",
  it should be UTF-8.

* Copy your java libraries (.jar files) into "java.ext.dirs" (see
  result.html). Copy the php_java.dll into the extension directory
  of your PHP 5.0.3 installation. (Or copy php-cgi.exe, php5ts.dll
  and php_java.dll into the CGI bin folder of your web server and 
  re-start the web server.)

* Add the following entry to your php.ini:

          extension = php_java.dll
          [java]
  
* Copy the test.php into your web-server document root and browse to:

    http://localhost/test.php

* If you have problems, start the PHP/Java Bridge at log level 3

    java -jar JavaBridge.jar 9167 3 output.log

  or a higher log level and examine the output. Please report
  bugs/problems to the mailing list:

    php-java-bridge-users@lists.sourceforge.net


Known Windows Issues 
--------------------

* Security Enhanced Linux not supported.

* Local ("unix domain") sockets, struct ucred and the Linux abstract
  namespace not supported.
  
* You cannot install your .jar files in /usr/share/java.  Install your
  .jar files into %JAVA_HOME\jre\lib\ext instead and then re-start the
  java VM.

* java.hosts option switched off. The windows version can only connect
  to a single host: 127.0.0.1:9167.

* The windows binary cannot be run as a sub-process of the Apache web
  server.

* Windows 98 does not support UTF-8.  To force the bridge to use UTF-8
  anyway, start it with:
  java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 JavaBridge.jar

* Due to cr -> cr/lf conversion the bridge expects one more character
  at the end of the stream and reports this if the log level is >=1.
  The message is harmless and can be switched off by using log level 0,
  which is default on windows.

This folder contains examples which show how to connect to the
PHP/Java Bridge from PYTHON and GUILE/Scheme.


* getProperties.py: Connects to the PHP/Java Bridge, asks for
  System.getProperties() and displays the first entry.

* listToArray.scm: Connects to the PHP/Java Bridge, creates a
  java.util.ArrayList and fills it with three entries. Then it receives
  the entire array list from the server and displays it.

These examples use the python and guile/scheme script languages. They
can be obtained from:

   http://www.python.org

and

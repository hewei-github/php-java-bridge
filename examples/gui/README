These examples show how to create GUI applications with PHP.

* swt-button.php: Uses SWT to create a native GUI on windows or
  unix. SWT is part of eclipse and can be downloaded from
  www.eclipse.org.

* swing-button.php: This example uses java swing. In order to use
  swing you must switch it on, for example by setting the
  java.lang.System property "java.awt.headless" to false. Otherwise you
  will get an "awt headless" exception. Please note that swing has
  several design problems which translate into a extensive number of
  swing related bugs and system crashes. One such problem is that swing
  creates UI threads which may cause the application to hang. Please
  do not use swing to create a java GUI, please use SWT or GTK instead.

* gtk-button.php: This example uses mono gtk. You need the
  PHP/Mono+Net Bridge and gtk-sharp installed on the system.

* gtk-fileselector.php: An example which opens a file selector via
  mono gtk. You need the PHP/Mono+NET Bridge and gtk-sharp installed
  on the system.

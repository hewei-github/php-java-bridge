This directory contains JSR 223 tests for the pure Java PHP
implementation "quercus". To run them start the PHP/Java Bridge with
the command:

  java -jar JavaBridge.jar SERVLET_LOCAL:8090 3

and browse to 

  http://localhost:8090/tests.php5/


These files need a Java library called "quercus" which can be obtained
from www.caucho.com.

This directory contains a pure PHP implementation of the PHP/Java
Bridge: it doesn't require a Java extension ("java.so" or
"php_java.dll") installed on the web server.

WARNING: THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS 2 TO 10 TIMES SLOWER THAN THE C
IMPLEMENTATION[1].



Usage
-----

* Type java -jar JavaBridge.jar SERVLET:8080

* To call out to your Java libraries require java/Java.inc
  and use the provided Java class as usual. Example:

<?php

  require_once("http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge/java/Java.inc");
  $string = new Java("java.lang.String", "HelloWorld");
  echo $string;

?>

* On a server connected to the internet use SERVLET_LOCAL:8080 or
  use a J2EE/Servlet engine and the JavaBridge.war instead.

[1] Depending on whether a PHP opcode cache and a native XML parser is
used. And whether or not the operating system uses Nagle's algorithm
for the local interface. When PHP >= 5.1.4 is used on Linux, Solaris
or Windows with eaccelerator enabled, the pure PHP implementation
isn't much slower than the C based implementation.

However, on other operating systems (MacOSX, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD)
you may need to tune TCP socket performance and recompile the PHP
binary or use the C based implementation with Unix domain sockets
instead.

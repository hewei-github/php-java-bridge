// This php-java-bridge security is too permissive and suitable for development tests only.
// For production environment a more strict security is needed.
// This file was tested at placement:
// /etc/tomcat5.5/policy.d/60JavaBridge.policy
// Please, contribute your security configuration to the php-java-bridge project.
// As of php-java-bridge 5.4.4.2, the Java engine security is not actually enough for
// blocking malicious code from php. The real solution should be using 
// Security Enhanced Linux policies.

grant codeBase "file:${catalina.base}/webapps/JavaBridge/-" { permission java.security.AllPermission; };

// For development only, you may even comment out the following configuration:

grant {
  permission java.io.FilePermission "${user.home}${/}-", "read,write,delete";
  permission java.io.FilePermission "${java.io.tmpdir}${/}-", "read,write,delete";
  permission java.io.FilePermission "${java.home}${/}-", "read";
  permission java.util.PropertyPermission "*", "read";

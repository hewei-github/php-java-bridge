If this directory does NOT contain a php CGI executable called
php-cgi-<architecture>-<os>[.exe|.sh], the following system default
FastCGI or CGI binary will used: /usr/bin/php-cgi or c:/php5/php-cgi.exe.

If this directory DOES contain a php CGI executable, the bridge will
call it using the CGI interface.


Copy an executable PHP CGI binary into this directory. Or copy a PHP
CGI binary into this directory and create a wrapper
(recommended). Please see the php-cgi-x86-linux.sh and
php-cgi-i386-linux.sh for a template.

Note that FastCGI is currently only available on Unix/Linux; the
pre-compiled Windows php-cgi.exe doesn't support the necessary -b
option.

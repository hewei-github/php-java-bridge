	* README: GNU Java supported

	The SUN Java implementation may store objects on the stack.
	Objects on the heap may reference them. So in this JVM we cannot
	simply longjmp to clear the stack, because some heap objects may
	still refer to dead locations.  The result would be that the VM
	will barf when the GC tries to follow these phantom references.
	* natcJavaBridge.c: Longjmp to the last savepoint, then return
	back to java, throw an exception to return to one of the three
	native main methods and then jump back to the loop.  This fixes a
	crash in the SUN VM which occured after apache has aborted the
	connection.

	* php-java-bridge 1.0.3 released.

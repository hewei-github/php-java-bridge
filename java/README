This directory contains a pure PHP implementation of the PHP/Java
Bridge: it doesn't require a Java extension ("java.so" or
"php_java.dll") installed on the web server.

WARNING: THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS 10 TIMES SLOWER THAN THE C
IMPLEMENTATION.


Installation
------------

* Copy the PHP classes to the web server.

* Copy the Java libraries you need into the WEB-INF/lib folder within
  JavaBridge.war and copy JavaBridge.war into the deploy folder of the
  J2EE server or servlet engine and start it (if necessary).

* To call out to your Java libraries require java/Java.php
  and use the provided Java class as usual. Example:

<?php

  require_once("java/Java.php");
  $string = new Java("java.lang.String", "HelloWorld");
  echo $string;

?>

* If the J2EE server or servlet engine does not run on the same
  computer as the web server, change the JAVA_HOSTS option (see
  Options.php) accordingly.

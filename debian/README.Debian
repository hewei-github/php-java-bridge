php-java-bridge for Debian
--------------------------

This Debian package was compiled for installing modules, not a complete install.
Also, it must use Sun Java 5, as of today.
Compilation against GCJ is possible, but some tweaks must be done. Read the other document files.
The Makefile.frag must be copied over the original one at the php-java-bridge source directory.

What is the PHP/Java bridge?
----------------------------

  The PHP/Java Bridge is a PHP module which connects the PHP object
  system with the Java object system. It can be used to access java
  based applications running in a java application server. The
  PHP/Java bridge communicates with the application server through local
  sockets using an efficient communication protocol.  This means that
  only one JVM runs to serve all clients within a multi-process
  HTTP-Server.  Each client process communicates with a corresponding
  thread spawned by the running application server.

  If the bridge does not detect a running java application server, 
  it starts a private java process to serve further requests.

  The bridge adds the following primitives to PHP:

  * new java("CLASSNAME"): References and instanciates the class
    CLASSNAME. After script execution the referenced classes may be
    garbage collected. To access classes within other classes the
    class$innerClass syntax must be used instead of the normal dot
    notation. Examples:

      $String = new java("java.lang.String");
      print $String->valueOf(null);

      $hello = new java("java.lang.String", "hello");
      print $hello;

      $inner = new java("package.testClass$innerClass");
      $inner->value = 2;

  * new java_class("CLASSNAME"): References the class CLASSNAME but
    does not call a constructor. The object returned is the class
    object. After script execution the referenced classes may be garbage
    collected. Example:

      $Class = new java_class("java.lang.Object");
      $obj = $Class->newInstance();

  * java_set_library_path("JAR1;JAR2"): Makes additional libraries
    available to the current script. JAR can either be a "http:", "ftp:",
    "file:" or a "jar:" location. Example:
     
      $file=new java("java.io.File", "WEB_INF/web.xml");

      java_set_library_path("file:c:/xerces.jar;http://localhost/jdom.jar");
      $builder = new java("org.jdom.input.SAXBuilder");
      $doc = $builder->build($file);
      $root = $doc->getRootElement();
      $servlets = $root->getChildren("servlet");
      java_set_library_path("");

      echo "this file has " . $servlets->size() . " servlets\n";

  * java_exception: A java exception class. Available in PHP 5 and
    above only. Example:

      try {
       new java("java.lang.String", null);
      } catch(java_exception $ex) {
         $trace = new java("java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream");
         $ex->printStackTrace(new java("java.io.PrintStream", $trace));
         print "java stack trace: $trace\n";
      }

  * java_instanceof(OBJECT, CLASS): Tests if the java object OBJECT is
    an instance of the java class CLASS or not. Example:

      foreach($list as $key=>$value) {
        if($value instanceof java)
          if(java_instanceof($value, $ListClass))
            ...
      }

  * java_last_exception_get(): Returns the last exception instance or
    null. Example:

      if(java_last_exception_get()) 
        java_last_exception_get()->getMessage();

  * java_last_exception_clear(): Clears the error condition. Example:

      java_last_exception_clear();
      while(!java_last_exception_get()) {
        ...
      }

  There is one example provided: test.php.  You can either invoke the
  test.php by typing ./test.php or copy the example into the document
  root of you web-server and invoke the file using the browser.

  The PHP/Java bridge is a replacement for the ext/java bridge shipped
  with PHP 4.  It is not possible to run the build-in bridge and the
  PHP/Java bridge at the same time.  Since version 1.0.7 the bridge is
  compatible with the proposed jsr223 (where applicable).  However,
  instead of writing javaclass() and javaexception, you can use
  java_class() and java_exception.

  The module has been tested on a Mandrake Linux System (Version 9.2),
  on RedHat Enterprise 3, RedHat Fedora Core 1 and 2, Solaris9 (Sparc,
  64 Bit JVM) and Windows98 with RedHat Cygwin, but it should run on
  all Unix-like operating systems including HP-UX, MacOS-X,
  WinXP/Cygwin.

  Custom java libraries (.jar files) can be stored in the following
  locations:

   1. Somewhere on a HTTP or FTP server, see PHP function
      java_set_library_path.

   2. In the sub-directory "lib" of the PHP extension directory, if it
      exists and is accessible when the JVM starts the bridge.
      This is usually "`php-config --extension-dir`/lib".

   3. In the /usr/share/java/ directory, if it exists and is accessible
      when the JVM starts the bridge.


  The PHP/Java Bridge can operate in 5 different modes:

   1. Invoked from the dl() function.  This is very slow because it
      starts a new Java VM for each request.  But this mode does not
      require any administrative privileges.

   2. Compiled into PHP.  This is not recommended because it
      requires a compilation of the entire PHP library. If you want to
      do this, please see the Windows install description below.

   3. Permanently activated in the global php.ini file.  This is
      recommended, see below.

   4. Permanently activated in the global php.ini file with an
      external java process.  Recommended for web servers, see below.
      This mode is used by the RPM package available for RedHat
      Enterprise Linux.

   5. Compiled with the GNU Java library.  You can either start
      GNU Java as a separate process (just like a "real" Java VM) or
      compile the GNU Java library into the PHP/Java Bridge.
      You can even compile the PHP/Java Bridge + GNU/Java directly
      into PHP to create a huge PHP binary or library.


Build and execution instructions:
---------------------------------

  In the directory php-java-bridge-1.x.y type:

          java -version        # 1.3 or above (1.4.2_02 or IBM JVM recommended)
          gcc --version        # 3.2.3 or above.
          apachectl -version   # Apache 1.3 or above.
          php-config --version # PHP 4.3.2 or above.

          phpize && 
          ./configure --with-java=/opt/IBMJava2-14 &&
          make &&
          su -c "make install"
        
  If your administrator allows you to dynamically load extensions, you
  can now test the extension by invoking the test.php with the 
  command: php ./test.php.

------------------------------------
   Permanently activate the module
   -------------------------------

  To permanently activate the extension for all users please add the
  following lines to the php.ini or add a file java.ini to the
  directory that contains the php module descriptions (usually
  /etc/php.d/) with the following content:

          extension = java.so
          [java]
          java.log_level=1
          java.log_file=/var/log/php-java-bridge.log
          # It is recommended to enable the following option and
          # to start a JVM as a separate process.
          #java.socketname=/var/run/.php-java-bridge_socket

  After the module is activated verify that the module is running by
  typing:

          echo "<?php phpinfo()?>" | php | fgrep "java status"

  Other configuration options which should have been set up by the
  configure script but which can be changed later are:

          java.libpath   = <system dependent path to natcJavaBridge.so>
          java.classpath = <system dependent path to JavaBridge.class>
          java.java_home = <system dependent path to the java install dir>
          java.java      = <system dependent path to the java binary>
          java.socketname= <hard-coded socketname to start the VM separately>

  If you change the above values, please first look at the output of
  phpinfo() to see the original values.

---------------------------------------------
   Starting the Java VM as a separate process
   ------------------------------------------

  If you want to test the extension in the web-server, you should enable
  the java.socketname option and start the java VM before you start the
  web-server.  The java VM can be started either via the
  "php-java-bridge" script or by typing the following command:

            JAVA_HOME=<java.java_home> <java.java> \
                                        -Djava.library.path=<java.libpath>
                                        -Djava.class.path=<java.classpath> 
                                        -Djava.awt.headless=true  
                                        JavaBridge 
                                        <java.socketname>
                                        <java.log_level>
                                        <java.log_file>

  For example in a gnome-terminal type:

            JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk1.4 $JAVA_HOME/bin/java \
                    -Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/php4 \
                    -Djava.class.path  =/usr/lib/php4 \
                    -Djava.awt.headless=true \
                     JavaBridge \
                     /var/run/.php-java-bridge_socket \ 
                     1 \
                     "" | tee /var/log/php-java-bridge.log

  If you are unsure how to start the java process, please look at the
  output of the above phpinfo() command.  One of the last lines shows
  the command required to start the JVM.  The distribution contains two
  scripts tested on RedHat Enterprise Linux 3.  They start the JVM based
  on the information from phpinfo(). The "php-java-bridge" command
  starts the JVM and the "php-java-bridge.service" can be used on SysV
  based init systems to automatically start and stop the bridge as a
  service.

------------------------------------
  Using GNU Java
  --------------

  In case you don't want to ship a JVM or JRE with your product,
  you can use GNU gcc to compile the java part and your classes
  into native code. 
  In the directory php-java-bridge_1.x.y type:

   gcj --version  # must be gcj 3.3.3 or above!

   phpize && ./configure && make &&  su -c "make install"

  This creates a native, dynamic linked executable in the PHP
  extension directory.  It can be started with the command:

      `php-config --extension-dir`/java <java.socketname> <loglevel> <log-file>

  For example:

      `php-config --extension-dir`/java /var/run/.php-java-bridge_socket 1 "" |
        tee /var/log/php-java-bridge.log

  Then direct the bridge to the server-socket by hard-coding the
  java.socketname to /var/run/.php-java-bridge_socket (as described
  in the install instructions) and re-start the apache service.

  If you now invoke the test.php file, you should see the
  output from GNU Java (e.g.):

   ./test.php | fgrep java.vendor
     java.vendor -> Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     java.vendor.url -> http://gcc.gnu.org/java/

  GNU gcc is a "ahead of time" compiler. That means that classes
  which are added after compilation must be interpreted by the
  GNU java interpreter.  There's no "just in time" compiler.
  To compile your classes with the java executable you can append 
  the classes, java or jar files at the end of the java_SOURCES
  line of the server/Makefile.am.  For example:
    
  java_SOURCES= java.c JavaBridge.java my_file.java

  Then type "make install" to re-install the binary. 

  If you want to compile the server part as a separate component;
  the server sub-directory is driven by autoconf and has been
  configured with the command:

     sh autogen.sh
     dir=../modules
     ./configure --with-java --libdir=$dir --datadir=$dir --bindir=$dir

  After you have created the executables you can distribute the 
  contents of the php-java-bridge-x.y.z/modules directory. It
  should contain the files "java", "libnatcJavaBridge.so", "java.so"
  (autoconf/libtool creates other files, you can delete them). The
  java.so is the PHP module, the other files are required to start the
  server part.  The "java" executable may need other system libraries, 
  for example "gcj.so" and "gcc_s.so". They should be installed on the 
  target system.

  Additional shared libraries can be copied into the php extension
  directory (see command "php-config --extension-dir"), additional
  java libraries (.jar files) can be installed in the sub-directory
  lib/ of the php extension directory.

  GNU Java still has some limitations.  Because the SUN java classes
  are not free software, all GNU java classes had to be written from
  scratch.  It may happen that the GNU java classes contain bugs or
  have certain limitations.  For example con.getContentLength()
  constantly returns -1; length not available.
   
  However, GNU java is already good enough to be used as a bridge
  between PHP and the "real" java application server such as BEA
  WebLogic. It can be used to implement the presentation- and,
  depending on the project, even the service layer.

  | -----------------WEB SERVER --------------------- | -- APP SERVER --|
    Web-Server |<LOCAL SOCKETS>| PHP/Java Bridge |<TCP/IP>|  Java Apps   
    php <-low level communication -> gnu jvm <- value objects -> sun jvm

------------------------------------
  64 Bit issues
  -------------
  
  It is possible to compile the bridge into 64 bit code:

          phpize && ./configure --with-java=$JAVA_HOME
          make CFLAGS="-m64"
  
  The scripts expect that the default JVM found in
  $JAVA_HOME/bin/java is a 64 bit VM. Unfortunately this is not true
  for the SUN JDK (Linux and Solaris) installation. The SUN JDK
  installs the 64 bit VM in some sub-directory of $JAVA_HOME/bin. On
  Solaris9 this is $JAVA_HOME/bin/sparcv9. The location on Linux may
  depend on the architecture.

  Since there is no standard installation directory and we cannot
  blindly search all sub-directories, it is your job to direct the
  bridge to the 64 bit JVM.  The relevant php.ini entry is java.java,
  see install instructions above.

------------------------------------
  Windows Installation
  --------------------

  This operating system has some unusal problems with shared libraries
  (DLL's). The autoconf/libtool documentation states:

   - Macro: AC_LIBTOOL_WIN32_DLL
     This macro should be used if the package has been ported to build
     clean dlls on win32 platforms.  Usually this means that any
     library data items are exported with `__declspec(dllexport)' and
     imported with `__declspec(dllimport)'.  If this macro is not used,
     libtool will assume that the package libraries are not dll clean
     and will build only static libraries on win32 hosts.

  Until someone ports the sources to use __declspec, we avoid 
  creating shared libraries on this system.  Instead we will
  compile the extension into PHP:

  1. Install the source code of PHP 4.3.x.

  2. Install RedHat's Cygwin (PHP needs autoconf).

  3. Delete the java sub-directory from php-4.3.x/ext and replace it
     with our php-java-bridge. Rename ext/php-java-bridge to
     ext/java.  Edit the file php-4.3.x/ext/java/config.m4 and replace
     the first 4 lines with these:

      sinclude(ext/java/tests.m4/function_checks.m4)
      sinclude(ext/java/tests.m4/java_check_broken_stdio_buffering.m4)
      sinclude(ext/java/tests.m4/java_check_broken_gcc_installation.m4)

  4. Invoke autoconf to register our java module within the PHP build
     tree and then compile php as usual:
 
      autoconf && ./configure --with-java && make

  This will create a php binary with the PHP/Java Bridge included.
  You can then copy the executable into the CGI directory of your IIS
  Web-Server.

------------------------------------
  Loading on-demand with dl()
  ---------------------------

  It is possible to load the bridge for each new request, for example
  with:

    <?php
    if (!extension_loaded('java')) {
      if (!dl("java.so")) {
        exit(1);
      }
    }
    phpinfo();
    ?>

  However, this feature is meant for testing, only.  For a production
  system it is recommended to compile PHP in save mode (which switches
  off the dl() function) and to activate all modules in the global
  php ini file.

------------------------------------
  Recognized CFLAGS
  -----------------

  During compilation you can use the following CFLAGS.

   * -DJAVA_COMPILE_DEBUG: Enables the assert() statement and other
     debug code.
   
   * -DJAVA_COMPILE_DEBUG -O0 -g3: Include full debug information into
     the binary.

   * -m64: Build 64 bit code. Required if you run a 64 bit JVM.

   * -m32: Build 32 bit code. Required if you run a 32 bit JVM on a 64
     bit system.

   * -DCFG_JAVA_SOCKET_ANON: Use the BSD/Linux abstract namespace instead
     of creating a socket file.  Will only work on modern Linux/BSD
     implementations but not on MacOS X for example (struct ucred is
     non-standard).  Experimental. 

   * -DCFG_JAVA_INPROCESS: Do not use exec() but call the JVM directly.
     Experimental.
     
  Example: make CFLAGS="-m64"

------------------------------------
  Log levels
  ----------

  You can set the java.log_level to 5 values:

   0: Log nothing, not even fatal errors.

   1: Log fatal system errors such as "out of memory error".

   2: Log java exceptions.

   3: Log info messages such as "loading jar xyz.jar from http://xy.com"

   4: Log debug messages, including the c/s communication protocol.

  The default log level is 1.

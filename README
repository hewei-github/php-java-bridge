What is the PHP/Java Bridge?
----------------------------

  The PHP/Java Bridge is PHP module which connects the PHP object system
  with the java object system. It implements JSR 223 (where applicable)
  and can be used to access java based applications from PHP
  scripts. The PHP/Java Bridge communicates with the java VM through
  local sockets using an efficient communication protocol. Each
  request-handling PHP process of a multi-process HTTP server
  communicates with a corresponding thread spawned by the java VM.

  Requests from more than one client may either be routed to a single
  application server running the PHP/Java Bridge or each client may
  own a PHP/Java Bridge and communicate with a J2EE application server
  by exchanging java value objects; client stub classes (ejb/j2ee client .jar) 
  can be loaded at run-time. 

  The bridge adds the following primitives to PHP:

   * new java("CLASSNAME"): References and instanciates the class
     CLASSNAME. After script execution the referenced classes may be
     garbage collected. Example:

       $String = new java("java.lang.String");
       print $String->valueOf(null);

       $hello = new java("java.lang.String", "hello");
       print $hello;

       // access the inner class AQUA within HSSFColor, note the $ syntax.
       $Color = new java('org.apache.poi.hssf.util.HSSFColor$AQUA');
       print $Color->index;

   * new java_class("CLASSNAME"): References the class CLASSNAME
     without creating an instance. The object returned is the class object
     itself, not an object of the class. After script execution the
     referenced classes may be garbage collected. Example:

       $Object = new java_class("java.lang.Object");
       $obj = $Object->newInstance();

   * java_set_library_path("JAR1;JAR2"): Makes additional libraries
     available to the current script. JAR can either be a "http:", "ftp:",
     "file:" or a "jar:" location. Example:

       $file=new java("java.io.File", "WEB_INF/web.xml");

       java_set_library_path("file:c:/xerces.jar;http://localhost/jdom.jar");
       $builder = new java("org.jdom.input.SAXBuilder");
       $doc = $builder->build($file);
       $root = $doc->getRootElement();
       $servlets = $root->getChildren("servlet");
       java_set_library_path("");

       echo "this file has " . $servlets->size() . " servlets\n";

   * java_exception: A java exception class. Available in PHP 5 and
     above only. Example:

       try {
         new java("java.lang.String", null);
       } catch(java_exception $ex) {
          $trace = new java("java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream");
          $ex->printStackTrace(new java("java.io.PrintStream", $trace));
          print "java stack trace: $trace\n";
       }

   * foreach(COLLECTION): It is possible to iterate over values of
     java classes that implement java.util.Collection or 
     java.util.Map. Available in PHP 5 and above only. Example:

       $conversion = new java("java.util.Properties");
       $conversion->put("long", "java.lang.Byte java.lang.Short java.lang.Integer");
       $conversion->put("boolean", "java.lang.Boolean");
       foreach ($conversion as $key=>$value)
          echo "$key => $value\n";

   * [index]: It is possible to access elements of java arrays or
     elements of java classes that implement the java.util.Map
     interface. Available in PHP 5 and above only. Example:

       $Array = new java_class("java.lang.reflect.Array");
       $String = new java_class("java.lang.String");
       $entries = $Array->newInstance($String, 3);
       $entries[0] ="Jakob der Luegner, Jurek Becker 1937--1997";
       $entries[1] ="Mutmassungen ueber Jakob, Uwe Johnson, 1934--1984";
       $entries[2] ="Die Blechtrommel, Guenter Grass, 1927--";
       for ($i = 0; $i < 3; $i++) {
          echo "$i: " . $entries[$i] ."\n";
       }

   * java_instanceof(JAVA_OBJ, JAVA_CLASS): Tests if JAVA_OBJ is an
     instance of JAVA_CLASS. Example:

       $Collection=new java_class("java.util.Collection");
       $list = new java("java.util.ArrayList");
       $list->add(0);
       $list->add(null);
       $list->add(new java("java.lang.Object"));
       $list->add(new java("java.util.ArrayList"));
       foreach ($list as $value) {
          if($value instanceof java && java_instanceof($value, $Collection))
            /* iterate through nested ArrayList */
          else
            echo "$value\n";
       }

   * java_last_exception_get(): Returns the last exception instance
     or null. Since PHP 5 you can use try/catch instead.

   * java_last_exception_clear(): Clears the error condition. Since
     PHP 5 you can use try/catch instead.

  There is one example provided: test.php. You can either invoke the
  test.php by typing ./test.php or copy the example into the document
  root of you web-server and evaluate the file using the browser.

  The PHP/Java bridge is a replacement for the experimental ext/java
  bridge shipped with PHP 4. It is not possible to run the build-in
  bridge and the PHP/Java bridge at the same time.

  The module has been tested on a Mandrake Linux System (Version 9.2),
  on RedHat Enterprise 3, RedHat Fedora Core 1..3, Solaris 8..10 (Sparc,
  64 bit JVM), FreeBSD 5.3 and Windows with RedHat Cygwin, but it should 
  run on all Unix-like operating systems including HP-UX, WinXP.


  Custom java libraries (.jar files) can be stored in the following
  locations:

   1. Somewhere on a HTTP or FTP server, see PHP function
      java_set_library_path.

   2. In the sub-directory "lib" of the PHP extension directory, if it
      exists and is accessible when the JVM starts the bridge.
      This is usually "`php-config --extension-dir`/lib".

   3. In the /usr/share/java/ directory, if it exists and is accessible
      when the JVM starts the bridge.


  The PHP/Java Bridge can operate in 5 different modes:

   1. Invoked from the dl() function.  This is very slow because it
      starts a new Java VM for each request.  But this mode does not
      require any administrative privileges.

   2. Compiled into PHP.  This is not recommended because it
      requires a compilation of the entire PHP library. If you want to
      do this, please see the Windows install description below.

   3. Permanently activated in the global php.ini file and started as
      a sub-component of the HTTP server.  Recommended for test
      installations only.

   4. Permanently activated in the global php.ini file with an
      external java process.  Recommended for production servers, see
      below. This mode is used by the RPM package available for RedHat
      Enterprise Linux.

   5. Compiled with the GNU Java library.  You can either start
      GNU Java as a separate process (just like a "real" Java VM) or
      compile the GNU Java library into the PHP/Java Bridge.
      You can even compile the PHP/Java Bridge + GNU/Java directly
      into PHP to create a huge PHP binary or library.


Build and execution instructions:
---------------------------------

  In the directory php-java-bridge-1.x.y type:

          java -version        # 1.3 or above (1.4.2_02 or IBM JVM recommended)
          gcc --version        # 3.2.3 or above.
          apachectl -version   # Apache 1.3 or above.
          php-config --version # PHP 4.3.2 or above.
          make null --version  # GNU make 3.79 or above

          phpize && 
          ./configure --with-java=/opt/IBMJava2-14 &&
          make &&
          su -c "make install"

  If your administrator allows you to dynamically load extensions, you
  can now test the extension by invoking the test.php with the 
  command: php ./test.php.

------------------------------------
   Permanently activate the module
   -------------------------------

  To permanently activate the extension for all users please add the
  following lines to the php.ini or add a file java.ini to the
  directory that contains the php module descriptions (usually
  /etc/php.d/) with the following content:

          extension = java.so
          [java]
          java.log_level=1
          java.log_file=/var/log/php-java-bridge.log
          # Comment out the following option if you want to
          # start the bridge automatically as a sub-process 
          # of the web-server, not recommended
          java.socketname=/var/run/.php-java-bridge_socket

  Re-start the web-server, for example with the command:

          apachectl restart

  Copy the php-java-bridge executable into the /usr/sbin directory
  and start the bridge, if it isn't already running.

          sh /usr/sbin/php-java-bridge

  After the module is activated verify that the module is running by
  typing:

          echo "<?php phpinfo()?>" | php | fgrep "java status"

  Other configuration options which should have been set up by the
  configure script but which can be changed later are:

          java.libpath   = <system dependent path to natcJavaBridge.so>
          java.classpath = <system dependent path to JavaBridge.class>
          java.java_home = <system dependent path to the java install dir>
          java.java      = <system dependent path to the java binary>
          java.socketname= <hard-coded socketname to start the VM separately>

  If you change the above values, please first look at the output of
  phpinfo() to see the original values.

---------------------------------------------
  Starting the PHP/Java Bridge automatically
  ------------------------------------------

  When the java.socketname option is not set, the web-server will
  start or re-start the bridge automatically as a sub-component when the
  http service is started or re-started.

  However, when running the bridge in a production environment, it is
  recommended to start the PHP/Java Bridge as a system service,
  independent of the web-server. The script "php-java-bridge.service"
  can be used on SysV based init systems to automatically start and stop
  the bridge as a system service.  Please see the RedHat RPM download
  for an example.

------------------------------------
  64 Bit issues
  -------------
  
  It is possible to compile the bridge into 64 bit code:

          phpize && ./configure --with-java=$JAVA_HOME
          make CFLAGS="-m64"
  
  The scripts expect that the default JVM found in
  $JAVA_HOME/bin/java is a 64 bit VM. Unfortunately this is not true
  for the SUN JDK (Linux and Solaris) installation. The SUN JDK
  installs the 64 bit VM in some sub-directory of $JAVA_HOME/bin. On
  Solaris9 this is $JAVA_HOME/bin/sparcv9. The location on Linux may
  depend on the architecture.

  Since there is no standard installation directory and we cannot
  blindly search all sub-directories, it is your job to direct the
  bridge to the 64 bit JVM.  The relevant php.ini entry is java.java,
  see install instructions above.

------------------------------------
  Windows Installation
  --------------------

  This operating system has some unusal problems with shared libraries
  (DLL's). The autoconf/libtool documentation states:

   - Macro: AC_LIBTOOL_WIN32_DLL
     This macro should be used if the package has been ported to build
     clean dlls on win32 platforms.  Usually this means that any
     library data items are exported with `__declspec(dllexport)' and
     imported with `__declspec(dllimport)'.  If this macro is not used,
     libtool will assume that the package libraries are not dll clean
     and will build only static libraries on win32 hosts.

  Until someone ports the sources to use __declspec, we avoid 
  creating shared libraries on this system.  Instead we will
  compile the extension into PHP:

  1. Install the source code of PHP 4.3.x.

  2. Install RedHat's Cygwin (PHP needs autoconf).

  3. Delete the java sub-directory from php-4.3.x/ext and replace it
     with our php-java-bridge. Rename ext/php-java-bridge to
     ext/java.  Update the "sinclude" paths in
     php-4.3.x/ext/java/config.m4 so that they start with "ext/java/":

      sinclude(ext/java/tests.m4/function_checks.m4)
      sinclude(ext/java/tests.m4/java_check_broken_stdio_buffering.m4)
      sinclude(ext/java/tests.m4/java_check_broken_gcc_installation.m4)

  4. Invoke autoconf to register our java module within the PHP build
     tree and then compile php as usual:
 
      autoconf && ./configure --with-java && make

  This will create a php binary with the PHP/Java Bridge included.
  You can then copy the executable into the CGI directory of your IIS
  Web-Server.

------------------------------------
  Loading on-demand with dl()
  ---------------------------

  It is possible to load the bridge for each new request, for example
  with:

    <?php
    if (!extension_loaded('java')) {
      if (!dl("java.so")) {
        exit(1);
      }
    }
    phpinfo();
    ?>

  However, this feature is meant for testing, only.  For a production
  system it is recommended to compile PHP in save mode (which switches
  off the dl() function) and to activate all modules in the global
  php ini file.

------------------------------------
  Recognized CFLAGS
  -----------------

  During compilation you can use the following CFLAGS.

   * -DJAVA_COMPILE_DEBUG: Enables the assert() statement and other
     debug code.
   
   * -DJAVA_COMPILE_DEBUG -O0 -g3: Include full debug information into
     the binary.

   * -m64: Build 64 bit code. Required if you run a 64 bit JVM.

   * -m32: Build 32 bit code. Required if you run a 32 bit JVM on a 64
     bit system.

   * -DCFG_JAVA_INPROCESS: Do not use exec() but call the JVM directly.
     Experimental.
     
  Example: make CFLAGS="-m64"

------------------------------------
  Log levels
  ----------

  You can set the java.log_level to 5 values:

   0: Log nothing, not even fatal errors.

   1: Log fatal system errors such as "out of memory error".

   2: Log java exceptions.

   3: Log info messages such as "loading jar xyz.jar from http://xy.com"

   4: Log debug messages, including the c/s communication protocol.

  The default log level is 1.

------------------------------------
  UTF-8
  -----
  
  The PHP/Java Bridge uses the java VM's default "file.encoding" to
  convert characters into the host representation.  On Unix the java VM
  determines the host representation by looking at the LANG environment
  variable.

  In order to use UTF-8 in your PHP scripts, the LANG environment
  variable must be set to an UTF-8 locale, for example en_US.UTF-8. This
  is default on all modern operating systems, but certain components may
  select a different locale. Apache for example runs with the C locale
  and if the PHP/Java bridge is started automatically as a sub-component
  of apache, it will inherit this setting. -- This is one of the reasons
  why it is recommended to start the bridge as a system service outside of
  apache.

  You can check the file.encoding with the test.php script, see above.
------------------------------------
  Macintosh/PPC Installation
  --------------------------
  
  The PHP/Java Bridge doesn't compile on OSX 10.2 or earlier because
  certain functionality (sys/poll) is missing.  OSX 10.3 has issues
  with the dynamic loader and the Apple Java VM, which cannot run
  the bridge reliably.

  If you want to run the Bridge on a Mac/PPC, please install IBM java
  1.4.1 or above on RedHat Enterprise Linux for Power PC, please see

    http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/linux/tested.html

  for details.  

---------------------------------------------
  GCJ/GNU Java issues
  -------------------
  
  gcc3.4 cannot invoke virtual functions from jni code.  Please apply
  the gcc3.4-broken-jni-method-lookup.patch or use gcc 3.3.3 or gcc 4.x
  instead.

  Running the PHP/Java Bridge under GCJ/GNU Java is supported on Linux
  and Solaris only.  If you run FreeBSD 5.3, please use Sun, Blackdown
  or IBM java instead.

------------------------------------
  Security Enhanced Linux
  -----------------------

  SELinux is an implementation of a flexible and fine-grained
  mandatory access control architecture implemented in the Linux kernel.
  It is used in recent Linux distributions such as Debian or RedHat
  Fedora Core 3.

  A system component running on a SELinux kernel must declare
  exactly a) which resources of the operating system it needs in order
  to function properly and b) what it provides to other components.

  The PHP/Java Bridge distribution contains two policy files,
  "php-java-bridge.te" and "php-java-bridge.fc". The
  "php-java-bridge.te" declares the javabridge_t domain and the
  resources it requires.  All domains are granted connect, read and
  write to the PHP/Java Bridge server socket, which is
  "@var/run/.php-java-bridge_socket" in the Linux abstract namespace,
  and file create/read/write in the tmp_t.  Everything else (connections
  to other servers, file access, ...) is currently denied.

  The "php-java-bridge.fc" contains the file contexts for the PHP/Java
  Bridge and the log.

  Installation:
  -------------
  The following discussion assumes that you have a RedHat Linux system
  and you are running SELinux with the targeted policy.

   1. Install selinux-policy-targeted-sources-*.rpm, for example with
      the command:

        rpm -i selinux-policy-targeted-sources-1.17.30-2.19.noarch.rpm

   2. Install the policy files with the command:

        su -c "make install_policy"

   3. Inject the new policy rules into the kernel. On RedHat Fedora
      Core 3 and above the command is:

        su -c "make -C /etc/selinux/targeted/src/policy reload"
      
  If the default policy is too restrictive and e.g. you want to use the
  PHP/Java Bridge to connect to your J2EE server(s) you can temporarily set 
  the policy to Permissive, for example with the command "setenforce
  Permissive" and connect to the server. Then extract the permissions
  from the audit log, for example with the command "audit2allow -d". Then
  append them at the end of the "php-java-bridge.te" file and load the
  updated policy into the kernel. Don't forget to switch back, for
  example with "setenforce Enforcing".

------------------------------------
  PHP 5 issues
  ------------

  Versions 5.0.0 up to 5.0.3 cannot load the Bridge from the dl()
  function.  If you use one of these versions, please either apply the
  php5-crash-in-evaluator-shutdown_workaround.patch or add an entry to
  the php.ini, see install instructions above.
